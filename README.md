# EnvelopeBudget 3.0

Welcome to the third incarnation of EnvelopeBudget (previously Inzolo)!

This version has been designed to be open source so that all the people who have reached out to me wanting to help can do so now and add whatever feature they want!

## Developer Setup

If you are running MacOS, simply run `./local_setup.sh`. It should install everything you need to run the development environment locally using docker-compose.

This will generate a placeholder `.env` file. Edit this file to the settings you would like.

To run the dev server, simply run `./run`.

### Keeping packages up to date

Use [pip-review](https://pypi.org/project/pip-review/) and [node-check-updates (ncu)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-check-updates) to keep your packages up to date on a regular basis.
