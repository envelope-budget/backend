  Hey there, curious coder! ðŸ‘‹

  You're peeking into the heart of EnvelopeBudget, where we blend budgeting with tech magic!
  Our stack?
    - Python 3 & Django 4
    - DB: Postgresql or SQLite
    - CSS: Bootstrap 5 & AdminLTE
    - JS: Alpine.js

  I deliberately decided to go old school and keep it simple to allow for more people to collaborate, so I have avoided large SPA frameworks.
  Thinking of contributing? Fantastic! We love collaboration.
  Whether you're a veteran developer or just starting out, your ideas and code are welcome here.
  If you're keen on improving EnvelopeBudget or have a cool feature in mind, let's make it happen together.

  Reach out to me, Dustin, at [your contact email] or through our GitHub repo.
  Whether it's a bug, a feature request, or just saying hi, I'm all ears. Let's push the boundaries of budgeting software, one line of code at a time!

  P.S. If you're into automation and deployment, I'm always game to discuss new, cutting-edge methods. Let's innovate!

  Happy coding!
  Dustin Davis
